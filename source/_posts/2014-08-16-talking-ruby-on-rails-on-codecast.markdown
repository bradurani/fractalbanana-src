On July 2nd I did this video podcast for <a href='http://stltechtalk.com/'>St. Louis Tech Talk</a>. The subject is mostly Ruby on Rails with some personal history and a discussion of <a href='http://www.launchcode.org/'>Launch Code</a> mixed in. There's no Ember talk despite what the title says, but don't worry, that will come later. Enjoy!
