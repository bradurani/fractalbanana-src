I live coded a game recently using my new obsession: [Elm](http://elm-lang.org)  

If you haven't tried Elm, you're missing out. It's a purely functional reactive programing language that compiles to JavaScript for front end web development. There are 4 hours of video from on [livecoding.tv](http://livecoding.tv) split into 4 parts:  
[Part 1a](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/building-a-game-in-elm-pt-1a/)  
[Part 2b](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/building-a-game-in-elm-pt-1b/)  
[Part 2](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/building-a-game-in-elm-2/)  
[Part 3](https://www.livecoding.tv/video/building-a-game-in-elm-3/)  
  
The finished program is on [GitHub](https://github.com/bradurani/connect-four-elm). The master branch is the completed program with a computer player AI using the minimax algorithm. branches [part-1](https://github.com/bradurani/connect-four-elm/tree/part-1) and [part-2](https://github.com/bradurani/connect-four-elm/tree/part-2) contain the code I wrote during the livecoding sessions
