This is the video from [Scale15x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/15x). My
talk starts at **3:42:00**. I talk about the challenges we face at [Procore](https://procore.com)
migrating our database at scale under heavy load, day in and day out. And about
the gem I wrote, [handcuffs](https://www.github.com/procore/handcuffs), that is
one of the tools that enables our team to accomplish this feat. Enjoy!
