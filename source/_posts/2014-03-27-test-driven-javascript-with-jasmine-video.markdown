Here is a video of a presentation I gave at the [STLJS meetup](http://www.meetup.com/STL-JS-meetup/) on January 16th, 2014 entitled Test-Driven JavaScript with Jasmine. The source code for the demo is on my GitHub page [here](http://https://github.com/bradurani/ConwaysGameOfLifeJasmineDemo) and the slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ASDGgdkzKuJ7Epwzf0T3M1Mw-jXhlH5NRIqyFKa31Pk/edit?usp=sharing)
